Panel Tabs Extension for Chrome
===============================

**A button that opens tabs in Chrome panels.**

“Panels” is a cool and relatively new Chrome experiment that allows opening
web pages in docked or floating windows outside of Chrome itself.

A panel looks like this:

Usage
-----

1. [Install the extension][3] from the Chrome Web Store.
2. Click on the extension’s icon and follow the instructions to enable panels.
3. After restarting Chrome, navigate to a page you want to open as a panel
   and click the extension’s icon again.

Why I created this
------------------

This extension started out as a spur-of-the-moment weekend project. I had to
do some repetitive coding stuff and I wanted to watch Netflix while doing it.

I tried out some of the existing Chrome extensions, but they weren’t as well
made as I liked them to be, or they had all kinds of bells and whistles that
I didn’t need. Besides, I don’t really want to install closed-source
extensions that ask all kinds of permissions.

Feature requests
----------------

I’m trying not to add any distracting features. I want this to do just one
thing, but do it well.

I’ll consider new features if they...

1. are within the scope of the original idea: opening tabs as panels.
2. solve a real problem that most users might encounter.
3. won’t distract the user.

Permissions
-----------

See the [wiki page on permissions][4] that explains what permissions are used
and the reasoning behind each permission.

Please note that you can also browse through the code to see exactly what’s
being done with the data.
