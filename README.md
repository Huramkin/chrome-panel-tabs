===============================

Panels is a cool and relatively new Chrome experiment that allows opening tabs
in docked or floating windows outside of Chrome itself.

This extension makes using those panels as simple as possible. You can open
any web page as a panel! Panels are great for e.g. watching Netflix while
doing other stuff.

Feature requests
----------------

I want this extension to do one thing, but do it well. I’ll consider new
features if they...

1. are within the scope of the original idea: opening tabs as panels.
2. solve a real problem that most users might encounter.
3. won’t be distracting.

Permissions
-----------

See the [wiki page on permissions][4] that explains what permissions are used
and the reason behind each permission.

Please note that you can also browse through the code to see exactly what’s
being done with the data.
