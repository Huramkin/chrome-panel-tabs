Panel Tabs Extension for Chrome
===============================

**A button that opens tabs in Chrome panels.**

“Panels” is a cool and relatively new Chrome experiment that allows opening
web pages in docked or floating windows outside of Chrome itself.

A panel looks like this:

Usage
-----

2. Click on the extension’s icon and follow the instructions to enable panels.
3. After restarting Chrome, navigate to a page you want to open as a panel
   and click the extension’s icon again.

Why I created this
------------------

To watch Netflix while coding in the evenings. Now you can too!
